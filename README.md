# Welcome to the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure 🚀

Welcome to the LLVM project! This repository houses the source code for LLVM, a powerful toolkit for building highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and runtime environments.

## What is LLVM? 🛠️

The LLVM project consists of multiple components, with the core itself called "LLVM." It includes all the necessary tools, libraries, and header files for processing intermediate representations and transforming them into object files. This toolbox offers various utilities, such as an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and bitcode optimizer.

🌟 For C-like languages, we use the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) frontend. Clang compiles C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ code into LLVM bitcode, which is then further processed into object files using LLVM.

🔗 Other key components include:
- [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org)
- [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org)
- And more!

## Getting Started 🏁

If you're new to LLVM and want to get the source code and build LLVM, check out our [Getting Started with LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#getting-the-source-code-and-building-llvm) page for detailed instructions on building and running LLVM.

## Contributing 🤝

We encourage contributions to the LLVM project! To learn how you can contribute to the project, please take a look at the [Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) guide.
